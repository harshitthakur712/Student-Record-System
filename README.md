INTRODUCTION:
    This is a student record management system project, which enables you to create, read, modify, and delete student Records. It utilizes file handling
    and shows the class and object of the programming language. It is a very effective and simple understanding of beginners.
    This system is based on a concept to store and generate all the records of the students. Also, this program has a simple database of students for a
    school where the user can add student details safely and itâ€™s not time-consuming. This System makes it easy to store records of each. Moreover, the
    user can view all the records, modify and remove the details. Also, this project is easy to operate and understand by the users.

 

OBJECTIVES:
Student Management system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data.
It provide capabilities for registering students in courses,Admitting students, tracking student attendance and Submitting students documents and fee payment online.
Ensure data integrity, privacy, and security in an open-access environment.
 

 3. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
     OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows or Linux

     COMPILER: DEV C++ or any best for C++.

 

How it works
     Each  functionality has a function call in switch statement on the user choice control transfers to a function. Every function opens a file name     
     "database" and insert, show and search data from it. File will be created where c++ file is placed in secondary storage.

 

FRONT-END:  C++ Language
BACK-END:  Binary Files
PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM:
       The system maintains records of students, the courses and modules on which they are registered and the outcome of their studies.The     
       application is distributed application because the data is stored centrally by the university but accessed by academic staff and administrators     
       across the university.Students also access the system to view their results.The real system would be service oriented and would expose some
       of its functionality as a set of services which could be consumed by other applications. 

 

Features of Student Record System :
      Simple functions have been to manipulate data structure and file handling, so here I will just list the features of this project.
